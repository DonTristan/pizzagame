---Pizza Game---
Pizza Game is a demo with multiple
gamemodes that show of my python
based pizza-drawing engine.


---Installation---
1. Create a new folder on your
   desktop or where you keep your
   games, and call it something
   that you will remember

2. Drag the zip file into that
   folder and then extract the
   files there

   If you don't know what program
   to use to extract the files,
   Windows has the function built
   in. Alternatively, I recommend
   using either 7zip or WinRAR

  *IMPORTANT:                     *
  *NEVER USE ANYTHING FROM THE    *
  *WINDOWS APP STORE. THE PROGRAMS*
  *THEREFROM DO NOT WORK          *

3. Make sure you have Python ver.
   3.9.0 or later installed
   https://python.org/downloads/

4. Double click the run.bat file
   to start and play the game!

5. (Optional) Right click the
   run.bat file and press "create
   shortcut" to create a shortcut
   
   You can then drag that to your
   desktop and rename it whatever
   you want!

Hope you enjoy it! :)
